    "Description": "This story is estimated at 5 Story Points (as shown in the \"Estimate\" field at the top right of the Detail View). \n\nTry updating the Story Point estimate to 4 by clicking on the \"Estimate\" then typing.\n\n*Estimating using Story Points*\n\nBecause the traditional process of estimating tasks in weeks or days is often wildly inaccurate, many Scrum teams estimate in Story Points instead. Story Points exist merely as a way to estimate a task's difficulty compared to some other task (for example, a 10-point story would probably take double the effort of a 5-point story). As teams mature with Scrum they tend to achieve a consistent number of Story Points from Sprint to Sprint -- this is termed the team's _velocity_. This allows the Product Owner to use the velocity to predict how many Sprints it will take to deliver parts of the backlog. \n\nMany teams use Planning Poker to achieve consensus on Story Point estimates.\n\n*Using Other Estimation Units*\n\nYou can configure JIRA Software to use time-based estimates if you wish. In the configuration for the board, on the \"Estimation\" tab, select \"Original Time Estimate\" as your Estimation Statistic. If you also wish to track the time used during the Sprint, select \"Remaining Estimate and Time Spent\" to enable Time Tracking in JIRA Software.",

    "Description": "When you click \"+ Create Issue\" you will be asked for the correct project (select \"Sample Scrum Project\") and Issue Type (select \"Story\").\n\n*About User Stories*\n\nThe Scrum methodology drops traditional software requirement statements in favour of real world problems expressed as User Stories. Stories describe the task a particular user is trying to achieve and its value. They are typically of the form \"As a (role) I want (something) so that (benefit)\". This approach focuses the team on the core user need rather than on implementation details. \n\nStories are \"placeholders for a conversation\" -- they do not need to be especially detailed since it is expected that the team will work together to resolve ambiguity as the story is developed. \n\nStories to be implemented in the future are stored in the Product Backlog. The backlog is ranked by the Product Owner so that the next items to be completed are at the top.",

    "Description": "*About Scrum*\n\nScrum is an iterative approach to Agile software development. The methodology has been around since the 1980s but was popularised by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber. \n\nScrum breaks the development of a product down in to discrete iterations (termed Sprints) that each deliver functionality that could potentially be shipped to users.\n\nThe Scrum Alliance offers an excellent [introduction to Scrum|http://www.scrumalliance.org/resources/47] that provides an overview of key Scrum concepts, stakeholders, processes and artefacts.",
